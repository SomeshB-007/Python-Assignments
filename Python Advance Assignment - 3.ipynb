    "An abstract superclass is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a blueprint for other classes. It defines common properties and methods that its subclasses can inherit and use, but it also typically contains some abstract methods (methods without a implementation) that must be overridden by its subclasses. This allows for shared functionality among subclasses while still allowing them to have unique implementation."
